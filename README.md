# Installation
`npm install country-code-info --save`

# Usage

const CountryCodes = require('country-code-info');

// you can search countries by any data field
// by passing in a key value pair
// key: data field
// value: value to search for

let uk = CountryCodes.findCountry({'name': 'United Kingdom'});
/* returns:
{
	'name': 'United Kingdom',
	'a2': 'GB',

	'num': '826',

*/

// examples showing searching by various data fields
let uk = CountryCodes.findCountry({'fifa': 'eng'});
let uk = CountryCodes.findCountry({'dial': '44'});

// if you need to match exactly the string you pass in
// as the search term, you can pass in a second argument
// to findCountry function which will enable exact match.
let uk = CountryCodes.findCountry({'ds': 'gb'}, true); // exact match
```

# Notes

If a country is not found, a `null` object is returned.

Key and Value pairs are not case-sensitive so `{'name':'united kingdom'}` and `{'NAME': 'united kingdom'}` are treated in the same way.

If an invalid data field key is used or a search object is not provided, errors are thrown.
